\textbf{Common design drivers (RS)}

frequency structure

gain pattern{~}

\begin{itemize}
%\tightlist

  shape
\item
  variation with frequency
\end{itemize}

  filters
\item
  differentials among signal paths
\end{itemize}

long and short paths

1/f ``noise''

noise characteristics

\textbf{Calibration approaches{~ }(LJG)}

Bandpass calibration

Calibration of additives

some sub-units can be cal'd in the lab, others only in the field.

Ideal goal: flat spectral baseline to 1:10\textsuperscript{6}{~}

Compromise to admit spectral baselines that are at least partially
orthogonal to 21-cm signals

Switching

\begin{itemize}
%\tightlist
\item
  Dicke switching
\item
  ways in which to separate what is up and downstream from frontend
  switch
\item
  inbuilt noise and calibration sources
\end{itemize}

correlation spectrometers -- phase switching

when all else fails, fit a model to the spectral baseline

\begin{itemize}
%\tightlist
\item
  physically motivated
\item
  empirical
\item
  dangers
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Experimental Challenges (RS)}

Foregrounds

%\tightlist
\item
