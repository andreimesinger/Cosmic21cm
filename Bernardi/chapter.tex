The Van Cittert-Zernike theorem expresses the fundamental relationship between the sky spatial brightness (or brightness distribution) $I$ and the quantity measured by an interferometer, i.e. the visibility $V$ (e.g., \cite{TMS}):
\begin{equation}
V_{ij} ({\bf b}, \lambda) = \int_\Omega {\bar I} (\hat{\sigma}, \lambda) \, e^{-2 \pi i {\bf b} \cdot {\hat \sigma}} d {\bf \sigma},
\label{eq:1}
\end{equation}
where ${\bf b}$ is the baseline vector that separates antenna~$i$ and antenna~$j$, and $\hat{sigma}$ is the observing direction (see Figure~\ref{fig:fig1}) and the integral is taken over the source size $\Omega$. The baseline vector is here specified in wavelengths, i.e. ${\bf b} = \frac{{\bf b_{\rm m}}}{\lambda}$, where ${\bf b_{\rm m}}$ is the baseline vector expressed in meters and $\lambda$ is the observing wavelength. It can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:fig1}, that the celestial signal travels an extra path between the two antennas, and that length corresponds to a geometrical time delay $\tau = {\bf b} \cdot {\hat \sigma}$, where the word ``geometrical" refers to the fact that the delay depends upon the source position in the sky and the relative separation between the two antennas.

The sky brightness distribution does not enter directly in equation~\ref{eq:1}, but filtered by the antenna primary beam response $A$ that depends upon the direction in the sky and the wavelength, i.e. ${\bar I} ({\bf b}, \lambda) = A ({\bf b}, \lambda)  \, I ({\bf b}, \lambda)$. The response of the primary beam attenuates the sky emission away from the pointing direction, effectively reducing the field of view $\theta$ of the instrument. Generally speaking, the size of the field of view is essentially given by the antenna diameter $D$: 
\begin{equation}
\theta \approx \frac{\lambda}{D}.
\label{eq:2}
\end{equation}
Equation~\ref{eq:1} is often re-written in a different coordinate system, i.e. using the components of the baseline vector $(u,v,w)$ and the reciprocal $(l,m,n)$, where $(l,m)$ are the coordinates in the plane on the sky tangent to the observing direction $n$ (for a detailed discussion of coordinate systems see, for example \cite{TMS}). Using this coordinate system, equation~\ref{eq:1} becomes (e.g., \cite{TMS}):
\begin{equation}
V_{ij} (u,v,w, \lambda) = \int_\Omega {\bar I} (l, m, \lambda) \, e^{-2 \pi i (ul + vm + w(n - 1))} \frac {dl \, dm \, dn}{\sqrt{1 - l^2 - m^2}},
\label{eq:3}
\end{equation}
Although low frequency radio observations are intrinsically wide-field, for the purpose of studying the 21~cm observables, we can reduce equation~\ref{eq:3} to a two dimensional Fourier transform:
\begin{equation}
V_{ij} (u,v, \lambda) = \int_\Omega {\bar I} (l, m, \lambda) \, e^{-2 \pi i (ul + vm)} dl \, dm.
\label{eq:4}
\end{equation}
Equation~\ref{eq:4} indicates that an {\it interferometer measures the two dimensional Fourier transform of the spatial sky brightness distribution}. If our goal is to reconstruct the sky brightness distribution, equation~\ref{eq:4} can be inverted into its corresponding Fourier pair:
\begin{equation}
%{\bar I} (l, m, \lambda) = \int_{- \infty}^{+ \infty} V_{ij} (u,v, \lambda) \, e^{2 \pi i (ul + vm)} du \, dv.
{\bar I} (l, m, \lambda) = \int V_{ij} (u,v, \lambda) \, e^{2 \pi i (ul + vm)} du \, dv.
\label{eq:5}
\end{equation}
Equation~\ref{eq:5} is, however, a poor reconstruction of the sky brightness distribution as only one Fourier mode is sampled at a single time instance. Strictly speaking, indeed, all the quantities in equation~\ref{eq:4} and \ref{eq:5} are time variable. In most cases, the time dependence of the primary beam and the sky brightness distribution can be neglected, however, this is not the case for the visibility $V$ as the projection of the baseline vector with respect to the source direction changes significantly throughout a long (e.g. a few hours) track. In this way, many measurements of the visibility coherence function $V$ can be made as $(u,v)$ change with time, allowing for a better reconstruction of the ${\bar I} (l, m, \lambda)$ function. This methods is commonly referred to as {\it filling the $uv$ plane via Earth rotation synthesis} and was invented by \cite{ryle60}. The other (complementary) way to fill the $uv$ plane is to deploy more antennas on the ground in order to increase the number of instantaneous measurements of independent Fourier modes. If $N$ antennas are connected in an interferometric array, $\frac{N (N - 1)}{2}$ instantaneous measurements are made. 

The combination of a large number of antennas and the Earth rotation synthesis, defines the sampling function $S(u,v)$ in the $uv$ plane. In any real case, equation~\ref{eq:5} can therefore be re-written as:
\begin{equation}
{\bar I}_D (l, m, \lambda) = \int S(u,v, \lambda) V (u,v, \lambda) \, e^{2 \pi i (ul + vm)} du \, dv,
\label{eq:6}
\end{equation}
where ${\bar I}_D$ indicates the sky brightness distribution sampled at a finite number of $(u,v)$ points (often termed {\it dirty image}) and where the explicit dependence on the antenna pair was dropped for simplicity. Using the convolution theorem, equation~\ref{eq:6} can be re-written as:
\begin{equation}
{\bar I}_D (l, m, \lambda)  =  \tilde{S \, V} =  {\tilde S} \ast {\tilde V} = {\rm PSF} (l, m, \lambda) \ast {\tilde V} (l, m, \lambda),
\label{eq:7}
\end{equation}
where the tilde indicates the Fourier transform, $\ast$ the convolution operation and PSF is the Point Spread Function, i.e. the response of the interferometric array to a point sources which, in our case, is also the Fourier transform of the $uv$ coverage.

%I will give some examples of sampling functions for different instruments in Section~\ref{sec:design}, however, 
The sampling function always effectively reduces the integral over a finite (often not contiguous) area of the $uv$ plane. In particular, the sampled $uv$ plane is restricted to a minimum $uv$ distance that cannot be shorter than the antenna\footnote{In this chapter I use the words ``antenna" and ``station" interchangeably to indicate the correlated elements even if, in the literature, they are normally used to indicate a dish and and a dipole, or a cluster of dipoles, respectively.} size and the largest separation between antennas, i.e. the maximum baseline ${\bf b}_{\rm max}$. The maximum baseline also sets the maximum angular resolution $\theta_b$:
\begin{equation}
\theta_b \approx \frac{\lambda}{|{\bf b}_{\rm max}|}.
\label{eq:8}
\end{equation}
The incomplete sampling of the $uv$ space leads to a PSF that has ``sidelobes", i.e. nulls and secondary lobes that can often contaminate fainter true sky emission. The best reconstruction of the sky brightness distribution ${\bar I}$ requires deconvolution of the dirty image from the PSF. 




\section{21~cm observables: power spectra and images}
\label{sec:observables}

The ultimate goal of 21~cm observations is to image the spatial distribution of the 21~cm signal as a function of redshift, also known as {\it 21~cm tomography}. Given the curent theoretical predictions, such observations need to achieve mK sensitivity on a few arcminute angular scales (see Chapter 1 in this book). Most of the current arrays, however, only have the sensitivity to perform a statistical detection of the 21~cm signal, i.e. to measure its power spectrum. Given an intensity field $T$, function of the three dimensional spatial coordinate $\bf x$, its power spectrum $P(k)$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
%\langle {\tilde T}^* ({\bf k}) {\tilde T}({\bf k'}) \rangle = (2 \pi)^3 P({\bf k}) \delta^3({\bf k} - {\bf k}')
\langle {\tilde T}^* ({\bf k}) {\tilde T}({\bf k'}) \rangle = (2 \pi)^3 P(k) \delta^3({\bf k} - {\bf k}')
\label{sec_observables_eq1}
\end{equation}
where $\langle \rangle$ indicates the ensamble average, $\bf k$ is the Fourier conjugate of $\bf x$, tilde the Fourier transform, $^*$ the conjugate operator and $\delta$ the Dirac delta function. In 21~cm observations, power spectra can be computed directly from interferometric image cubes after deconvolution of the dirty image ${\bar I}_D (l,m,\lambda)$ from the point spread function (e.g., \cite{pen09}, \cite{harker10}, \cite{beardsley16}, \cite{patil17}). Alternatively, the 21~cm power spectrum can be estimated directly from the interferometric visibilities. Equation~\ref{eq:4} already shows that the interferometer is a ``natural" spatial power spectrum instrument (e.g., \cite{white99}). Visibilities can be further Fourier transformed along the frequency axis (the so-called {\it delay trasform}, \cite{parsons12a}): 
\begin{equation}
{\tilde V}_{ij} (u,v, \tau) = \int_B {\bar I} (l, m, \nu) \, e^{-2 \pi i \nu \tau} d \nu
\label{sec_observables_eq2}
\end{equation}
where $B$ is the observing bandwidth and $\tau$ is the geometrical delay. The delay transform is therefore proportional to the three dimensional power spectrum (\cite{parsons12b}):
\begin{equation}
P(k) \propto {\tilde V}_{ij} (|{\bf b}|, \tau),
\label{sec_observables_eq3}
\end{equation}
where the proportionality constant transforms the visibility units into power units (\cite{parsons12b}). The observer units $({\bf b},\tau)$ map directly in $k$ modes parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight (e.g., \cite{morales04}):
\begin{equation}
k_\perp = \frac{2 \pi |{\bf b}|}{D_c} = \frac{2 \pi \sqrt{u^2 + v^2}}{D_c}, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,    k_\parallel = \frac{2 \pi f_{21} H_0 E(z)}{c \, (1 + z)^2} \, \tau,
\label{sec_observables_eq4}
\end{equation}
where $D_c$ is the transverse comoving distance, $f_{21} = 1421$~MHz, $H_0$ is the Hubble constant and $E(z) = \sqrt{\Omega)m (1+z)^3 + \Omega_k (1+z)^2 + \Omega_\Lambda}$. Due to the dependence of the geometrical delay upon frequency, equation~\ref{sec_observables_eq3} is only valid for short baselines, typically shorter than a few hundresd meters, for which the geometrical delay is fairly constant across the bandwidth and lines of constant $k_\parallel$ are essentially orthogonal to the $k_\perp$ axis (\cite{parsons12b}).

Equation~\ref{sec_observables_eq2} does not only provide a link between visibilities and three dimensional power spectra, but also introduces the concept of ``horizon limit", i.e. the maximum physical delay allowed $\tau_{\rm max} = \frac{|{\bf b}|}{c}$, where $c$ is the speed of light. The most relevant implication of the existence of an horizon limit is the definition of a region in the two dimensional $(k_\parallel,k_\perp)$ power spectrum space where smooth-spectrum foregrounds are confined, leaving the remaining area  uncontaminated in order to measure the 21~cm signal (the so-called ``Epoch of Reionization (EoR) window", Figure~\ref{fig:fig2}). Foregrounds can therefore be ``avoided" with no requirements for subtraction (e.g., \cite{morales12}, \cite{vedantham12}, \cite{pober13}, \cite{thyagarajan13}; see also Chapter~6 in this book).
\begin{figure}[]

A number of smooth spectrum point sources are simulated as foregrounds and their tracks are clearly bound within the horizon limit (black dashed line). The cyan emission is a fiducial 21~cm model that has power up to high delays regardless of the baseline length.}
\label{fig:fig2}
\end{figure}
The choice of a foreground avoidance strategy versus subtraction plays an important role in planning an experiment, its related observing strategy and the array calibration strategy.

The requirements for image tomography are the same as for high brightness sensitivity observations of diffuse emission like the Cosmic Microwave Background (e.g., \cite{halverson02}, \cite{dickinson04}, \cite{readhead04}). The 21~cm spatial distribution throughout cosmic reionization has structures on 5-10 arcminutes up to degree scales (e.g., \cite{datta12}, \cite{mellema13}, \cite{kakiichi17}). In order to image 21~cm fluctuations, a maximum baseline of the order of a few km gives a resolution of a few arcminutes in the $100-200$~MHz range, together with filled $uv$ plane in order to accurately reconstruct their complex spatial structure. A filled $uv$ plane also leads to a PSF with very low sidelobes, making the deconvolution process easier. The most stringent requirements for image tomography remain the accurate foregrond separation and, as I will review in the next section, the related instrumental calibration.



%\section{Challenges in 21~cm observations: interferometric calibration in presence of bright foreground emission, wide fields of view, ionosphere}
\section{Interferometric calibration and 21~cm observations}
\label{sec:challenges}

Celestial radio signals always experience a corruption when observed with an interferometric array, due to the non-ideal instrumental response that is corrected in post processing in a process that is known as interferometric calibration. Calibration relies on the definition of a data model where the corruptions are described by antenna based quantities known as Jones matrices. Such data model is known as the interferometric measurement equation (\cite{hamaker96},\cite{smirnov11}).

If antenna $1$ and antenna $2$ measure two orthogonal, linear polarizations $x$ and $y$, the cross-polarization visibility products can be grouped in a $2 \times 2$ complex matrix ${\bf V}$:
\begin{equation}
    {\bf V}_{12} (u,v,\lambda) \equiv 
    \left[ 
    \begin{array}{cc}
    V_{12,xx} (u,v,\lambda) & V_{12,xy} (u,v,\lambda) \\
    V_{12,yx} (u,v,\lambda) & V_{12,yy} (u,v,\lambda) \\
    \end{array}
    \right].   
\label{eq:sec:1}
\end{equation} 
The sky brightness distribution $I$ can also be written as a $2 \times 2$ matrix ${\bf B}$ using the Stokes parameters as a polarization basis:
\begin{equation}
    {\bf B}_I (l,m,\lambda) \equiv 
    \left[
    \begin{array}{cc}
    I (l,m,\lambda) + Q (l,m,\lambda) & U (l,m,\lambda) + iV (l,m,\lambda) \\
    U (l,m,\lambda) - iV (l,m,\lambda) & I (l,m,\lambda) - Q (l,m,\lambda) \\
    \end{array}
    \right].   
\label{eq:sec:2}
\end{equation} 
At this point, equation~\ref{eq:3} can be written by including the corruptions represented by the complex Jones matrices $J$: (\cite{hamaker96},\cite{smirnov11}):
\begin{equation}
{\bf V}_{12} (u,v,\lambda) = {\bf J}_1 \left( \int_\Omega {\bf B}_I (l, m, \lambda) \, e^{-2 \pi i (ul + vm)} dl \, dm  \right) {\bf J}_2^H
\label{eq:sec:3}
\end{equation} 
Equation~\ref{eq:sec:3} is known as the {\it measurement equation} and is the core of interferometric calibration. For an array with $N$ antennas, equation~\ref{eq:sec:3} can be written for each of the $\frac{N (N - 1)}{2}$ visibilities forming an overdetermined system of equations. The development of  algorithms to solve the calibration system of equations is a very active research line (\cite{mitchell08}, \cite{kazemi11}, \cite{tasse14}, \cite{yatawatta15}, \cite{smirnov15}) although beyond the scope of this chapter and we mention it here for completeness.

The solution of the measurement equation requires some knowledge of the sky brightness distribution ${\bf B}_I$, in other words, a {\it sky model}. Traditionally this is achieved by observing a calibration source, i.e. a bright, unresolved point source with known spectral and polarization properties. Calibration solutions are then applied to the observed field that is then used to improve the sky model ${\bf B}_I$ which, in turn, leads to more accurate calibration solutions ${\bf J}$. This loop that is traditionally called self calibration (\cite{cornwell81}, \cite{pearson84}) and can lead to a highly accurate calibration (e.g., \cite{bernardi10}, \cite{smirnov11b}).

The advantage of the measurement equation is that it can factorize different physical terms into different matrices. For example, the frequency response of the telescope electronics and its time variations essentially affects only the two polarization response and are modeled with a diagonal Jones matrix ${\bf B}$:
\begin{equation}
    {\bf B} (t,\lambda) \equiv 
    \left[
    \begin{array}{cc}
    b_x (t,\lambda) 	& 	0 	\\
    0 		& b_y (t,\lambda) 	\\
    \end{array}
    \right],   
\label{eq:sec:4}
\end{equation} 
where we made it explicit that ${\bf B}$ can vary with time and frequency. The undesired instrumental leakage between the two orthogonal polarized can be written as a ${\bf D}$ Jones matrix of the form:
\begin{equation}
    {\bf D} (t,\lambda) \equiv 
    \left[
    \begin{array}{cc}
    1	 		& d_x (t,\lambda)	\\
    -d_y (t,\nu)	& 1 	\\
    \end{array}
    \right],   
\label{eq:sec:5}
\end{equation} 
and the measurement equation can be written as:
\begin{equation}
{\bf V}_{12} (u,v,\lambda) = {\bf B}_1 \, {\bf D}_1 \left( \int_\Omega {\bf B}_I (l, m, \lambda) \, e^{-2 \pi i (ul + vm)} dl \, dm  \right) {\bf D}_2^H  \, {\bf B}_2^H.
\label{eq:sec:6}
\end{equation}
We note that, in principle, the primary beam response should appear as an additional $2 \times 2$ Jones matrix before the ${\bf D}$ matrix. For the purpose of this section we will neglect it, although we will illustrate an exception to this assumption when we later discuss about polarization calibration.

Retaining only the first order terms, equation~\ref{eq:sec:6} can be written as (\cite{sault96}):
\begin{eqnarray}
V_{12,xx} (u,v,\lambda) & = & b_{1,x} \, b_{2,x}^* [V_I (u,v,\lambda) - V_Q (u,v,\lambda)]\\
V_{12,xy} (u,v,\lambda) & = & b_{1,x} \, b_{2,y}^* [(d_{1,x} - d_{2,y}^*) V_I (u,v,\lambda) + V_U (u,v,\lambda) + iV_V (u,v,\lambda)]	\\
V_{12,yx} (u,v,\lambda) & = & b_{1,y} \, b_{2,x}^* [(d_{2,x} - d_{1,y}^*) V_I (u,v,\lambda) + V_U (u,v,\lambda) - iV_V (u,v,\lambda)]	\\
V_{12,yy} (u,v,\lambda) & = & b_{1,y} \, b_{2,y}^* [V_I (u,v,\lambda) - V_Q (u,v,\lambda)],
\label{eq:sec:7}
\end{eqnarray}
where we dropped the explicit dependence on time and wavelength from the Jones matrices for notation clarity and where $V_{i=I, Q, U, V}$ are the Fourier transforms of the elements of the sky brightness matrix ${\bf B}$.

This form of the measurement equation offers an intuitive understanding as to why calibration is of paramount important in 21~cm observations. The observed visibilities are essentially a measurement of foreground emission and, in the ideal case, their amplitudes would vary smoothly with frequency, allowing to avoid or subtract foregrounds. However, the instrumental response inevitably corrupts this smoothness in several ways: because the telescope primary beam is not sufficiently smooth in frequency, because of the electronic response or because of reflections along the signal path. Although calibration will correct for these effects and restore the intrinsic foreground frequency smoothness, calibration errors (i.e., deviations from the true ${\bf B}$ solutions) will still corrupt the foreground spectra. In practice, calibration errors result into foreground power leaking out of the horizon limit and jeopardizing (part of) the EoR window. The corruption of the foreground spectra will limit the accuracy of any subtraction method (see discussion in Chapter~6 in this book). {\it The effectiveness of foreground separation, proven in ideal cases, depends significantly on the accuracy of interferometric calibration.}

The form of the measurement equation written in equations~\ref{eq:sec:6} and \ref{eq:sec:7} is often referred to as a {\it direction independent} calibration as it implicitly assumes that a single Jones matrix is sufficient to describe corruptions across the whole sky area of interest. This assumption is often invalid at low frequencies, mostly because of the changing primary beam response over a wide field of view, frequency, and over the course of the observation, and the position and time dependent corruptions introduced by the Earth's ionosphere. In this case the measurement equation becomes {\it direction dependent}, i.e. a different Jones matrix is written and solved for a certain number of directions in the sky:
\begin{equation}
{\bf V}_{12} (u,v,\lambda) = \sum_s \left[ {\bf B}_{1,s} \left( \int_\Omega {\bf B}_{I,s} (l, m, \lambda) \, e^{-2 \pi i (ul + vm)} dl \, dm  \right) {\bf B}_{2,s}^H \right],
\label{eq:sec:7_added}
\end{equation}
where the sum is over the number of directions $s$. We note that we have used here the ${\bf B}$ matrix for pedagogical purposes, regardless of the physical origin of the direction dependent effect.
 
Developments in calibration of 21~cm observations are targeting a few main topics: 
%
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it sky models}. Ideally, the sky brightness model matrix ${\bf B}_I$ (equation~\ref{eq:sec:6} and \ref{eq:sec:7}) would include the whole sky emission. This is pratically impossible as part of the sky signal is the unknown of interest (the 21~cm signal) and the detailed properties of the foreground sky are not known sufficiently well. \begin{figure}[]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.\textwidth]{Bernardi/calibration_errors}
\end{center}
\caption{Example of power spectrum bias introduced by calibration errors due to an incomplete sky model for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA, left) and the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR, right) cases respectively (from \cite{ewall-wice17}). Power spectra are shown in their two dimensional $(k_\perp,k_\parallel)$ form in order to display the foreground dominated region below the horizon limit (grey solid line). Cyan, orange and red lines are the locii where a fiducial 21~cm model power spectrum is one, five and ten times higher than the bias level. In an ideal case with perfectly smooth foregrounds and no calibration errors, the 21~cm power sepctrum should be detectable just outside the horizon limit. The errors introduced by an incomplete sky model leak foreground power in the EoR window at a level that may completely prevent a detection in the MWA case.}
\label{fig:fig_added}
\end{figure}
Sky models are normally constituted of a catalogue of compact sources of known (or measured) properties, often covering an area significantly larger than the telescope field of view (e.g., \cite{yatawatta13}, \cite{pober16}). Nevertheless, sky models remain essentially always incomplete at some level, as source catalogues are limited in depth, source characterization and also sky coverage. \cite{grobler14}, \cite{wijnholds16} and \cite{grobler16} show that using incomplete catalogues as sky models biases the calibration and eventually leads to artifacts in the form of ghost-like sources in interferometric images, most of the times fainter than the image noise level. The ghost pattern is stronger for regularly spaced arrays and the more incomplete the sky model. \cite{ewall-wice17} and \cite{barry16} show that incomplete sky models bias the calibration solutions and lead to a leakage of foreground power in the EoR window (Figure~\ref{fig:fig_added}). A similar foreground leakage may occur because of the finite angular resolution of interferometric observations: for example, two sources whose size is respectively one third and one tenth of the instrument angular resolution will be both modeled as point like even if the first source is only barely unresolved. This biased catalogue would again lead to a leakage of foreground power in the EoR window (\cite{procopio17}). In this case, the bias can be mitigated by obtaining a sky model with an angular resolution much higher than the scales at which the 21~cm signal is expected to peak (\cite{procopio17}).

Sky models that include only compact sources are not adequate for baselines shorter than a few tens of meters as they are sensitive to Galactic diffuse emission, which contributes to most of the power on angular scales $\theta > 10-20$~arcmin (\cite{bernardi09}, \cite{choudhuri17}). Excluding short baselines from the calibration solutions prevents the problem of modeling diffuse emssion, but can bias the solutions (\cite{patil16}) if the system of calibration equation is not properly regularized (\cite{sardabaradi19}).

Significant effort is currently ongoing in order to improve sky models via wider and deeper low frequency surveys (e.g., \cite{hurley-walker17}, \cite{intema17}, \cite{shimwell19}), more accurate low frequency catalogues (\cite{carroll16}) and even better observations of Galactic diffuse emission (\cite{zheng17}, \cite{dowell17}); 
%Some of the calibration strategies described in the next sections may, however, mitigate the requirements of extremely accurate sky models;

\item {\it instrument/primary beam models}. A complete knowledge of a sky model may not be, by itself, sufficient for an accurate calibration of 21~cm observations as the brightness matrix ${\bf B}_I$ is multiplied by the antenna primary beam (equation~ \ref{eq:4} and \ref{eq:sec:3}) and the measurement of an intrinsic sky model requires the separation from the primary beam effect. 

Unlike steerable dishes, most 21~cm interferometers are constituted of dipoles fixed on the ground, in some cases clustered together to form larger stations whose beams that can be digitally pointed in a sky direction by introducing different delays to the dipoles (e.g., like the MWA and LOFAR arrays). As station beams are formed to track the source on the sky, the station projected area changes with time and the shape of the primay beam changes significantly (Figure~\ref{fig:fig3}). This effect leads to apparent time variable sky models where variations that are larger away from the pointing direction due to the larger changes in the sidelobe pattern. For examples, sky sources that are well within the main lobe of the primary beam in Figure~\ref{fig:fig3} will experience relatively negligible variations throughout an observation, the opposite will occur to sources located well outside the main lobe as they run through primary beam sidelobes.

Primary beams are also frequency variable and, at first order, their size scales with wavelength (equation~\ref{eq:2}), i.e. rather smoothly. However, in the sidelobe region, variations become rather abrupt as the source can be located on a sidelobe peak at a certain frequency and in the sidelobe null at another frequency. As a final remark, stations that include several dipoles are not perfectly equal to each other, due to manifacturing reasons or mutual coupling between their elements (e.g., \cite{sokolowski17}). As primary beams are different, the sky brightness matrix ${\bf B}_I$ is also different for each baseline. The left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:fig3} shows an example of how much primary beams vary for different stations due to mutual coupling interactions: variations in the sidelobe region can be as large as $\sim 30\%$.

If not accurately modeled and taken into account, primary beam effects can bias the calibration solution and, again, corrupt the foreground frequency smoothness.  \cite{bhatnagar08}, \cite{sullivan12} and \cite{tasse13} have developed methods to incorporate time and frequency variable primary beams in interferometric images, however, the accuracy of the correction is limited by the accuracy of the primary beam model. Increasing effort is therefore being placed in precise modeling and measurements of the  primary beams (e.g., \cite{pupillo15}, \cite{deleraacedo17}, \cite{jacobs17}, \cite{deleraacedo18});

It is visibile how different the sidelobe pattern is when pointing towards two different directions. It should also be noticed the $\sim 10\%$ magnitude of the first lobe and the large null regions around the sidelobes.

\item {\it polarization leakage calibration}. Equation~\ref{eq:sec:3} and \ref{eq:sec:7} show that, even if the 21~cm signal is unpolarized, care needs to be taken against the contamination from polarized foreground emission. Most point sources are unpolarized below 200~MHz (\cite{bernardi13}, \cite{lenc16}, \cite{vaneck18}), therefore the assumption of an unpolarized sky model is well justified. However, calibration errors (in the matrix ${\bf B}$) would lead  to a relative miscalibration of the $xx$ and $yy$ polarizations and, in turn, to leakage of polarized emission into total intensity. This effect may be particularly strong on short baselines (e.g., shorter than a $\sim 1$~km), where polarized foregrounds are brighter (\cite{bernardi09}, \cite{iacobelli13}, \cite{jelic15}, \cite{lenc16}). Polarized foregrounds that are Faraday rotated by the interstellar medium and leak to total intensity are a severe contamination to the 21~cm signal: they have a characteristic frequency dependence similar to the 21~cm signal therefore have power across the whole EoR window and cannot be subtracted using standard methods (e.g., \cite{jelic10}, \cite{moore13}, \cite{nunhokee17}).  

Even if calibration errors are negligible, low frequency antennas have a non negligible polarized response across their wide field of view. If we call ${\bf E} \equiv {\bf E} (l,m,\lambda)$ the Jones matrix that represents the polarized primary beam response, its associate measurement equation can be written as (\cite{nunhokee17}):
\begin{eqnarray}
    \left[ 
    \begin{array}{cc}
    V_{12,I} (u,v,\lambda)\\
    V_{12,Q} (u,v,\lambda)\\
    V_{12,U} (u,v,\lambda)\\
    V_{12,V} (u,v,\lambda)
    \end{array}
    \right] & = & \int_\Omega{ {\bf S}^{-1} [ {\bf E}_1 \otimes {\bf E}_2^H ] {\bf S} 
    \left[ 
    \begin{array}{cc}
    I (l,m,\lambda)\\
    Q (l,m,\lambda)\\
    U (l,m,\lambda)\\
    V (l,m,\lambda)
    \end{array}
    \right]
     \, e^{-2 \pi i (ul + vm)} dl \, dm } = \nonumber \\
     & = & \int_\Omega{ {\bf A} (l,m,\lambda) 
    \left[ 
    \begin{array}{cc}
    I (l,m,\lambda)\\
    Q (l,m,\lambda)\\
    U (l,m,\lambda)\\
    V (l,m,\lambda)
    \end{array}
    \right]
     \, e^{-2 \pi i (ul + vm)} dl \, dm },
\label{eq:sec:8}
\end{eqnarray} 
where ${\bf S}$ is the matrix that relates the intrisic Stokes parameters to the observer $x-y$ frame (\cite{hamaker96}) and $\otimes$ is the outer product. Visibilities are written as a four-element vector as this form shows that the ${\bf A}$ matrix maps the intrinsic Stokes parameters into the observed ones: 
\begin{eqnarray}
    \left(
    \begin{array}{cccc}
    I' \leftarrow I & I' \leftarrow Q & I' \leftarrow U & I' \leftarrow V \\
    Q' \leftarrow I & Q' \leftarrow Q & Q' \leftarrow U & Q' \leftarrow V \\
    U' \leftarrow I & U' \leftarrow Q & U' \leftarrow U & U' \leftarrow V \\
    V' \leftarrow I & V' \leftarrow Q & V' \leftarrow U & V' \leftarrow V \\
    \end{array}
    \right).
\label{eq:sec:8}
\end{eqnarray} 
An example of ${\bf A}$ matrix is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fig4}. The first raw of the matrix shows how the four intrisinc Stokes parameters contribute to the observed total intensity and, therefore, how polarized foregrounds leak into the 21~cm signal even in absence of any calibration errors: the amgnitude of the contaminating Stokes $Q$ and $U$ foregrounds increases away from the ponting direction. 

Calibration of polarization leakage remains a challenging task. Instruments with marrow fields of view naturally mitigate the leakege (\cite{asad15}, \cite{asad16}, \cite{asad18}). It can also be mitigated by extending the sky model to include polarization (e.g. \cite{geil11}), although modeling the diffuse Galactic foreground - the brightest component - is not straightforward and requires accurate imaging. However, \cite{nunhokee17} show that the magnitude of the Galactic polarization leakage may be below the 21~cm signal at high $k_\parallel$ values ($k > 0.3$~Mpc$^{-1}$) and, therefore, still be ``avoided". A more extensive characterization of the polarized foreground properties is needed in order to extend their results to a general case.

The second, the third and the fourth element of the first row show how Stokes parameters $Q$, $U$ and $V$ respectively contaminate the total intensity signal.}

The ionosphere is the partially ionized layer situated between $]sim 50$ and 1000 km above the surface of the Earth whose electron density changes with time and position. At low frequencies the ionosphere is no longer transparent to radio waves, and scattering the incoming celestial wavefronts. The scattering magnitude depends upon the

\subsection{Redundant calibration}

An interferometric array where most of the baselines have the same length and orientation is called {\it redundant} as they measure the same Fourier mode of the sky brightness distribution. Redundant array configurations are often not appealing as they have poor imaging performances as they do not measure sufficient Fourier modes to reconstruct accurate sky images. However, a maximally redundant array where the antennas are laid out in a regularly spaced square grid offers the maximum power spectrum sensitivity on the $k_\perp$ modes corresponding to the most numerous baselines. This criterium has inspired the highly redundant layouts of the MIT Epoch of Reionization experiment (\cite{zheng14}), the Precision Array to Probe the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER, \cite{parsons12b}) and partly driven the updated MWA.

One of the advantages of a redundant array is that it enables a different calibration strategy called {\it redundant calibration}. In redundant calibration the form of the measurement equation does not change and can be written, for a single polarization, like equation~\ref{eq:sec:7}:
\begin{equation}
V_{12,xx} (u,v,\lambda) = b_{1,x} \, b_{2,x}^* y_{12,xx} (u,v,\lambda),
\label{eq:sec:9}
\end{equation}
with the difference now that the model visibility $y$ is not tied to a sky model, but it is solved for, simply assuming that it is the same for each group of redundant baselines {\cite{wieringa92}, \cite{liu10}). In other words, redundant calibration is independent on the sky model and, therefore, bypasses entirely the biases related to sky model incompleteness described in Section~\ref{sec:challenges}. However, as redundant calibration is not tied to any physical (i.e. sky-based) spatial or spectral model, its solutions have degeneracies that need to be solved for by using a sky model (e.g., \cite{zheng14}, \cite{byrne19}). In particular, spectral calibration, which is critical for foreground separation, cannot currently be obtained using redundant calibration and requires a sky-based calibration. \cite{byrne19} suggest that sky model incompleteness can bias this calibration step, in a way similar to what happens with a traditional calibration scheme.

Redundant calibration is also prone to effects that break the assumption of redundancy, the most common being errors in the antenna positions and different primary beams for different antennas. Even if antenna position errors can be reduced to have a negligible impact on redundant calibration \cite{joseph18}, the effect of primary beam variations amongts the different antennas on redundant calibration is still largely unknown. {\bf Comment on the limitations of redundant calibration to treat polarization.}

\label{sec:design}

\caption{Cartoon illustration of the $uv$ footprint due to the primary beam.}
\label{fig:fig4}
\end{figure}
I will conclude this chapter by discussing how the various interferometric effects discussed so far impact the choice of array designs and the consequent observing strategies. \cite{morales05} and \cite{parsons12b}, for example, investigate how instrumental choices like the array layout, the antenna size and the bandwidth (do not) affect the 21~cm power spectrum spectrum. Here I would rather like to emphasize the interdependence between instrumental choices and calibration and foreground separation strategies. If the total collecting area is kept fixed, there are two main elements that impact calibration and foreground separation:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it station size}. The choice of station size determines the minimum $k_\perp$ value accessible and the footprint of each $uv$ measurement. Indeed each visibility is not a single point in the $uv$ plane but has a footprint corresponding to the two dimensional Fourier transform of the primary beam. This can be seen using the convolution theorem to re-write equation~\ref{eq:1}: 
\begin{equation}
V_{ij} ({\bf b}, \lambda) = \tilde{A} ({\bf b}, \lambda) \ast \tilde{I} ({\bf b}, \lambda).
\end{equation}

\item {\it array layout} Beyond the obvious sensitivity requirement, decisions need to be taken as to which layout to adopt, which antenna size and these choice are intrinsically related to calibration and foreground separation strategies. For instance a filled $uv$-coverage (between the minimum and the maximum station separation) is highly desirable for imaging, modeling and subtracting foregrounds. It is not a stringent requirement for power spectrum measurement and in the avoidance strategy. 
\end{itemize}



As examples, I will use four existing low frequency arrays that, concidentally, span the range of parameters of interest:

\begin{itemize}
\item effect of the field of view, calibratability, uv cell, drift scan versus tracking, suppression of sources outside the main lobe ionosphere
\item uv coverage choices power spectra vs images, redundant vs pseud random (reconstructing sky brightness), minimum/maximum k mode accessible... avoidance (compact) vs subtraction (less compact)
\item obviously sensitivity

\item {\it Low Frequency Array (LOFAR)}. LOFAR is an array mainly located in The Nerthelands but it include also remote stations acroos Europe. Each station

\item Murchison Widefield Array (MWA)

\item Precision Array to Probe the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER)

\item Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA)

\item Square Kilomtre Array (SKA)

\end{itemize}
